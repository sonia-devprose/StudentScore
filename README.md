**Student Performance Prediction Model**

This Python script simulates a basic student performance prediction model, leveraging key attributes such as study hours, completed assignments, and test scores. It demonstrates the use of arithmetic operations and conditional logic to assess a student's potential academic outcome.

**Key Features:**

* **Input Parameters:**
  - `student_hours`: Initial study hours
  - `student_assignment`: Initial completed assignments
  - `student_testscore`: Initial test score
  - `threshold_score`: Minimum score required to pass
  - `study_weight`: Weight assigned to study hours
  - `assignment_weight`: Weight assigned to completed assignments
  - `score_weight`: Weight assigned to test scores
* **Calculations:**
  - **Weighted Score Calculation:** Combines the weighted contributions of study hours, assignments, and test scores.
  - **Pass/Fail Prediction:** Determines whether the predicted score meets the threshold for passing.
* **Output:**
  - Displays the calculated predicted score.
  - Provides a pass/fail prediction based on the threshold.

**Potential Use Cases:**

* **Educational Institutions:** To identify students who may need additional support or intervention.
* **Tutoring Services:** To assess students' progress and tailor tutoring plans.
* **Individual Students:** To track their performance and set goals.

**Note:** This is a simplified model and actual student performance can be influenced by various factors, including learning styles, teaching methods, and external circumstances.
